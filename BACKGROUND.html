<p style="color:#ffffff;">astronaut, designation, derived from the Greek words for “star” and “sailor,” commonly applied to an individual who has flown in outer space. More specifically, in the West, astronaut refers to those from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who travel into space. Those Soviet and later Russian individuals who travel into space are known as cosmonauts (from the Greek words for “universe” and “sailor”). In Russia the word cosmonaut is used for space travelers of all nations. In the West, Chinese space travelers have come to be referred to as taikonauts (from the Chinese word for “space” and the Greek word for “sailor”), but in China the word yuhangyuan (from the Chinese words for “space” and “traveler”) is used.

As of 2022, 587 individuals from 41 countries had gone into orbit; 518 of these space fliers were men, and 69 were women. The longest time spent in space on one mission is the 438 days spent aboard the Russian space station Mir by cosmonaut Valery Polyakov in 1994–95. The longest individual cumulative time is the 878 days spent by cosmonaut Gennady Padalka on one mission to Mir and four missions to the International Space Station. Two U.S. astronauts, Franklin Chang-Díaz and Jerry Ross, made seven spaceflights, the most by any single individual. The youngest person to go into space was Oliver Daemen, who was 18 when he flew on the first flight of Blue Origin’s suborbital spacecraft New Shepard in 2021. The oldest astronaut was William Shatner, who was 90 when he flew on the second New Shepard flight in 2021.
